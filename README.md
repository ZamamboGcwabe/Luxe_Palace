This is my first portfolio project. I will be building an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I will be working on developing the backend as well at a later stage but for now my main focus is to master the backend development
Challenge
South Africa faces a significant challenge where local consumers often purchase from international vendors rather than supporting local businesses. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of access to advanced technologies and digital marketing tools for South African vendors, coupled with a general lack of knowledge and skills in website development. Consequently, many small businesses struggle to establish an online presence, limiting their growth and visibility.

To address this problem, our website aims to empower small businesses by providing an accessible platform for them to advertise and sell their products online. In this digital era, where online shopping is becoming increasingly prevalent, it is crucial for local vendors to have a robust online presence. Our platform will offer comprehensive tutorials guiding business owners on how to upload their merchandise and process payments effectively.

This initiative is designed to support local designers, jewellery makers, welders, and other artisans, helping them reach a broader audience. By fostering an environment where South Africans support their local entrepreneurs, we can reduce reliance on external markets and strengthen our local economy.
